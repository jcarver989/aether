Persist what you've learned to a topical notes file. Use this to keep track of project conventions, coding design, organization, and style preferences etc. Keep notes concise and in bulleted format.

## Usage

```json
{"topic": "coding-style", "content": "- Never add double-slash (//) comments to code unless it's to explain 'why?' we did something", "tags": ["coding", "style"]}
```

- `topic` — **required**, topic name (normalized to kebab-case for filename)
- `content` — **required**, the learning to record
- `tags` — optional array of tags for search

## Behavior

- If a note for this topic exists: merges tags, appends content, updates timestamp
- If not: creates a new note file
- Returns the full note content after the operation so you can see what's accumulated
