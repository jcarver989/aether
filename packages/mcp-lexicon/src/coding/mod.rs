        description = "A powerful search tool built on ripgrep for finding patterns in file contents.

Usage:
- ALWAYS use this tool for search tasks. NEVER invoke `grep` or `rg` as bash commands.
- Supports full regex syntax (e.g., \"log.*Error\", \"function\\s+\\w+\")
- Filter files with glob parameter (e.g., \"*.js\", \"**/*.tsx\") or type parameter (e.g., \"js\", \"py\", \"rust\")
- Output modes: \"content\" shows matching lines, \"files_with_matches\" shows only file paths (default), \"count\" shows match counts
- Use Task tool for open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds
- Pattern syntax: Uses ripgrep (not grep) - literal braces need escaping (use `interface\\{\\}` to find `interface{}` in Go code)
- Multiline matching: By default patterns match within single lines only. For cross-line patterns like `struct \\{[\\s\\S]*?field`, use `multiline: true`
- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively perform multiple searches in parallel if they are potentially useful."

Usage:
- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path
- By default, reads up to 2000 lines starting from the beginning of the file
- You can optionally specify a line offset (1-indexed) and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters
- Any lines longer than 2000 characters will be truncated
- Results are returned using line numbers starting at 1, formatted as '    1\\tline content'
- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use the list_files tool
- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple potentially useful files in parallel
- Assume this tool is able to read all files. If the user provides a path to a file, assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned

IMPORTANT - Safety Tracking:
- Reading a file successfully tracks it in the session
- You MUST read a file before you can edit it with edit_file or overwrite it with write_file
- This safety mechanism prevents accidental data loss and ensures you understand file contents before making changes"

Usage:

- The line number prefix format is: spaces + line number + tab character ('\\t'). Everything after that tab is the actual file content to match
- Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required
- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked
- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance of `old_string`
- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance")]

IMPORTANT: This tool is for terminal operations like git, npm, docker, cargo, etc. DO NOT use it for file operations (reading, writing, editing, searching, finding files) - use the specialized tools for this instead.

Usage:
- The command argument is required
- You can specify an optional timeout in milliseconds (up to 600000ms / 10 minutes). If not specified, commands will timeout after 120000ms (2 minutes)
- It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words in the description parameter
- If the output exceeds 30000 characters, output will be truncated before being returned to you
- You can use the `run_in_background` parameter to run the command in the background, which allows you to continue working while the command runs. You can monitor the output using the read_background_bash tool as it becomes available. Never use `run_in_background` to run 'sleep' as it will return immediately. You do not need to use '&' at the end of the command when using this parameter
- Avoid using bash with the `find`, `grep`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sed`, `awk`, or `echo` commands, unless explicitly instructed or when these commands are truly necessary for the task. Instead, always prefer using the dedicated tools for these commands:
  - File search: Use find tool (NOT find or ls bash commands)
  - Content search: Use grep tool (NOT grep or rg bash commands)
  - Read files: Use read_file tool (NOT cat/head/tail)
  - Edit files: Use edit_file tool (NOT sed/awk)
  - Write files: Use write_file tool (NOT echo >/cat <<EOF)
- When issuing multiple commands:
  - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple bash tool calls in a single message. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two bash tool calls in parallel
  - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, use a single bash call with '&&' to chain them together (e.g., `git add . && git commit -m \"message\" && git push`). For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts (like mkdir before cp, write_file before bash for git operations, or git add before git commit), run these operations sequentially instead
  - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail
  - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings)"

    #[tool(
        description = "Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current coding session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.

## When to Use This Tool
Use this tool proactively in these scenarios:
1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions
2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations
3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list
4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)
5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos
6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time
7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation

## When NOT to Use This Tool
Skip using this tool when:
1. There is only a single, straightforward task
2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit
3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps
4. The task is purely conversational or informational

## Task States and Management
1. Task States: Use these states to track progress:
   - pending: Task not yet started
   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)
   - completed: Task finished successfully

   IMPORTANT: Task descriptions must have two forms:
   - content: The imperative form describing what needs to be done (e.g., 'Run tests', 'Build the project')
   - active_form: The present continuous form shown during execution (e.g., 'Running tests', 'Building the project')

2. Task Management:
   - Update task status in real-time as you work
   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)
   - Exactly ONE task must be in_progress at any time (not less, not more)
   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones
   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely

3. Task Completion Requirements:
   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it
   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress
   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved
   - Never mark a task as completed if:
     - Tests are failing
     - Implementation is partial
     - You encountered unresolved errors
     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies

4. Task Breakdown:
   - Create specific, actionable items
   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
   - Use clear, descriptive task names
   - Always provide both forms:
     - content: 'Fix authentication bug'
     - active_form: 'Fixing authentication bug'

When in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully."
